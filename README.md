## **🎯 Project Goal**

This project aims to help beginners understand how to use basic Python Data Structures to build a simple but practical system.  
This project focuses on:
- Learning how to manage and organize data using Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets.
- Practicing basic Data Structure operations like adding, removing, updating, sorting, and searching in the data.
- Utilizing Conditional Statements for effective decision-making.
- Looping through multiple smart devices and list of devices to display the outputs clearly.
- Creating Functions for modular and reusable code.
